## HRDW-Automaton v2
Automaton v2 is a version of [HID Key](https://github.com/Freimor/HRDW-HIDKey) tuned for staff of the ANO "School 21". Main reason for redesign is changing a microcontroller to RP2040. Additional feature - you can choose type of USB connector (Male or Female) before soldering.
### Notes
- Side buttons is cool with additional plate
- Ability to choose USB type - ok, but not usable footprint must be covered by 3d printed case or elecrically isolated from circuit with 0 resistors.
- Case with glued window - NOT GOOD. Unreasonable assembly step.
- DON'T MESSED UP WITH CORE VOLTAGE!!! (1v1)

The project is completed in Q2 2023.
